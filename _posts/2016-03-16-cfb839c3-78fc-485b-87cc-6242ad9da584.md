  I said to my soul, be still and wait without hope, for hope would be hope for
  the wrong thing; wait without love, for love would be love of the wrong thing;
  there is yet faith, but the faith and the love are all in the waiting. Wait
  without thought, for you are not ready for thought: So the darkness shall be
  the light, and the stillness the dancing.
