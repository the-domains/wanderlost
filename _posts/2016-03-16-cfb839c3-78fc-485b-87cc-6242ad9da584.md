  . “I felt like lying down by the side of the trail and remembering it all. The
  woods do that to you, they always look familiar, long lost, like the face of a
  long-dead relative, like an old dream, like a piece of forgotten song drifting
  across the water, most of all like golden eternities of past childhood or past
  manhood and all the living and the dying and the heartbreak that went on a
  million years ago and the clouds as they pass overhead seem to testify (by
  their own lonesome familiarity) to this feeling.”
