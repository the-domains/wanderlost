  The familiar path under foot on the Sonoma hillside ignited shocks, which
  spread upwards into my limbs and spine, tickling my exposed, sweaty skin until
  finally bursting like firecrackers on the back of my skull and neck. The
  dispersed energy was aparant, giving momentary rest throughout my nervous
  system; up until my next forward. An unpleasant sensation that makes you want
  to sprint until all energy and nerves are exerted but I was paralyzed,
  formulating horrific images and questions to subdue those thoughts.
