  The familiar path under foot on the Sonoma hillside ignited shocks, which
  spread upwards into my limbs and spine, tickling my exposed, sweaty skin until
  finally bursting like firecrackers on the back of my skull and neck. The
  dispersed energy was aparant, giving momentary rest throughout my nervous
  system; up until my next forward. An unpleasant sensation that makes you want
  to sprint until all energy and nerves are exerted but I was paralyzed,
  formulating horrific images and questions to quell those thoughts

* This moment initiated a series of events and the darkest period of my life filled with follies that would humble a King. I now refer to as "the perfect storm." Rather than a monotonous, congruent timeline of events, I'd like to focus on specific, out of the ordinary, stories and fallacies that evoke common emotions and themes shared by all humans; ranging from loss and abandonment, inadequacies of self, addictions, etc... But also the human will to persevere despite any roadblock, where you will meet a close ally, your warrior spirit, and the tho of you will have tea and discuss politics. But no, your warrior exists and makes an appearance when we have no alternatives. lastly, Im excited to share how rewarding the glorious sensation of triumph feels on any level when your task is seemingly unattainable.
