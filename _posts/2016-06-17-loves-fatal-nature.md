* The news seemed to come from nowhere and still has me puzzled; though, I was a lying, addict and narcissist in compete denial to a laundry list of problems, but who wasn't, right...? Old familiar feelings of loss, jealousy, abandonment, lonlyness, fear, depression, shame, and anger would all arrive simultaneously hurting every inch of my being, without remorse or abandon. This stage of shock and loss was familiar to me, but once she left, and my habits became worse, I knew it was time to face the root causes of my unhappiness and behaviors. The pain hadn't even truly commencing yet. When my, now, ex-wife asked what was wrong, I calmy said, "Oh, I'ts just some anxiety right now, it should pass." That anxiety and emotional torture persisted for months apon months, Fairly consistently, and has only just recently subsided, 7 months after the fact. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4c3c4fe9-0a26-42f5-87cf-76c6134a0fb6.jpg)
