  The familiar path under foot on the Sonoma hillside ignited shocks, which
  spread upwards into my limbs and spine, tickling my exposed, sweaty skin until
  finally bursting like firecrackers on the back of my skull and neck. The
  dispersed energy was aparant, giving momentary rest throughout my nervous
  system; up until my next forward. An unpleasant sensation that makes you want
  to sprint until all energy and nerves are exerted but I was paralyzed,
  formulating horrific images and questions to quell those thoughts

* This moment initiated a series of events, filled with follies and bad decisions that would humble the almightiest of kings. I now refer to it as "the perfect storm." As a form of therapy, I'll fight my apprehension for writing, and share some stories and memories that will amuse as well as frighten anyone unaccustomed to walking the razors edge. Yet, ultimately I hope it will enlighten, since it's a universal theme of struggle and redemption. Rather than spew a monotonous, congruent timeline of events, I'll focus on specific, out of the ordinary events, as well as insight to the dilusions of a man on the brink of madness. Yes, just typical, common themes of loss, abandonment, inadequacies of self, addictions, delusional paranoia, etc... But also the human will to persevere despite any seemingly insurmountable roadblock, invoking the dormant warrior spirit we all possess and the tho of you will have tea and discuss politics. But no, your warrior exists and makes an appearance when we have no alternatives. lastly, Im excited to share how rewarding the glorious sensation of triumph feels on any level when your task is seemingly unattainable.
