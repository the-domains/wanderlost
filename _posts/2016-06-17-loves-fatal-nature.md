  This was the moment that initiated a series of events, where countless bad
  decisions turned what could have been a normal, painful divorce, into a fight
  for sanity and survival. I now refer to this period as "the perfect storm",
  since life caught up with me in all aspects at once. As a form of therapy,
  I'll fight my fear and apprehension to write, and share some stories and
  memories that will amuse as well as frighten the average reader. Ultimately, I
  hope to entertain and enlighten with universal themes of struggle and
  redemption. Rather than spew a monotonous, congruent timeline of events, I'll
  focus on specific, out of the ordinary events, as well as provide insight to
  the dilusions of man on the brink of madness. Yes, just typical, common run of
  the line themes of loss, abandonment, inadequacies of self, addictions,
  delusional paranoia, etc... There are a lot of humans in more pain than they
  would ever reveal, so I have no problems or shame in recounting experiences if
  it they can help another person in similar situations. The human will to
  persevere despite seemingly insurmountable roadblocks, is a powerful thing. We
  all possess potential to invoke the dormant warrior spirit, capable of
  whatever we put our mind to. Mine Has only recently peeked out to say, " yo,
  you need me? or can I go back to bed..."

![The familiar path under foot on the Sonoma hillside ignited shocks, which spread upwards into my limbs and spine, tickling my exposed, sweaty skin until finally bursting like firecrackers on the back of my skull and neck. The dispersed energy was aparant, giving momentary rest throughout my nervous system; up until my next forward. An unpleasant sensation that makes you want to sprint until all energy and nerves are exerted but I was paralyzed, formulating horrific images and questions to subdue those thoughts.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/19c60d79-7150-4049-8add-427d23bbcd94.jpg)
