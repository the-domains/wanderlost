  Being is not only beyond but also deep within every form as its innermost
  invisible and indestructible essence. This means that it is accessible to you
  now as your own deepest self, your true nature. But don't seek to grasp it
  with your mind. Don't try to understand it. You can know it only when the mind
  is still. When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in
  the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain
  awareness of Being and to abide in that state of "feeling-realization" is
  enlightenment.   Having access to that formless realm is truly liberating. It
  frees you from bondage to form and identification with form. It is life in its
  undifferentiated state prior to its fragmentation into multiplicity. We may
  call it the Unmanifested, the invisible Source of all things, the Being within
  all beings. It is a realm of deep stillness and peace, but also of joy and
  intense aliveness. Whenever you are present, you become "transparent" to some
  extent to the light, the pure consciousness that emanates from this Source.
  You also realize that the light is not separate from who you are but
  constitutes your very essence
