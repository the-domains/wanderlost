  Lost in a desert where affection is the water I can't decide if its's been
  months, or maybe longer, Since I laid my eyes upon you, Or the mirage I
  perceived you to be. As if you were a cactus who's affection is guarded, by
  skin too sharp, and thick to bleed. Sitting in this plateau surrounded by
  drier things, dead plants and dusty bones. A solivagant traveler is what I'll
  be.
