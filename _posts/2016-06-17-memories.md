  "Family life is full of major and minor crisis - the ups and downs of health,
  success and failure in career, marriage, and divorce- and all kinds of
  characters. It is tied to places and events and histories. With all of these
  felt details, life etches itself into memory and personality. It's difficult
  to imagine anything more nourishing to the soul."
