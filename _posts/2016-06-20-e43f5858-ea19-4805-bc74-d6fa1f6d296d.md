  My first attempt at blogging, with high hopes this creative venture will
  complete this painful transformational period. My painfully humorous,
  traumatic tales of finding humility will be the content to beta-test the
  web-builder, TheGrid; utilizing artificial intelligence to dictate A UI of
  superior style and design, in a scientific-like fashion, outclassing the class
  imposters. I've been excited for close to a year now to use it and was
  admittingly skeptic at times, but from what I've seen so far, this is
  something very special.
