  My first attempt at blogging, with high hopes this creative venture will
  complete this painful transformational period. My painfully humorous,
  traumatic tales of finding my humility will be the means to beta test for a
  the Grid; a web-builder, utilizing artificial intelligence to dictate an
  interface of superior style and design, in a scientific-like fashion,
  outclassing the great many class imposters. I've been excited for close to a
  year now and was admit tingly skeptic at times, but from what I see so far,
  this is something very special.
