  "For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin â€” real life.
  But there was always some obstacle in the way. Something to be got through
  first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid.
  Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my
  life."
