  A quiet mind is all you need. All else will happen rightly, once your mind is
  quiet. As the sun on rising makes the world active, so does self-awareness
  affect changes in the mind. In the light of calm and steady self-awareness,
  inner energies wake up and work miracles without effort on your part.
