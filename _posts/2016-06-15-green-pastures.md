  The familiar path under foot sent shocks from the toes, up through the limbs
  and spine and burst like fireworks throughout the skull and neck; only to
  repeat the proccess, downward throughout the electrical nervous system until
  the next step taken; a process repeated while the unexcpected news took hold
  as a possible reality. Old familiar feeling of loss, jealousy, abandonment,
  lonlyness, fear, depression, shame, and anger would arrive simultaneously and
  hurt without remorse or allow for any sanctuary from what can only be
  described as pure panic. When my now ex-wife asked what's wrong, I calmy
  said"Oh, I'ts just some anxiety right now, it will pass.". That anxiety and
  emotional torture persisted for months apon months straight and has only just
  recently subsided, 7 months after the fact. I'd like to write about this
  experience that turned out being a culmination of events I now refer to as
  "the perfect storm." rather that giving a congruent timeline of events, I'd
  like to focus on specific, out of the ordinary, stories that evoke common
  emotions and themes shared by the human race ranging from loss and
  abandonment, inadequacies of self, addictions, etc... But also on the human
  will to persevere despite any time constraint, the warrior we all possess but
  never encounter until fear of death is present, and lastly, how rewarding the
  glorious sensation of triumph feels when seemingly unattainable. I'll take my
  time with sharing my stories as I'm still in the midst of my battle. But I
  promise I'll come out tbe other side and am more than willing to help any
  other soil in pain.
