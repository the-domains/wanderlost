The familiar path under foot on the Sonoma hillside ignited shocks, which spread upwards into my limbs and spine, tickling my exposed, sweaty skin until finally bursting like firecrackers on the back of my skull and neck.  The dispersed energy was aparant,  giving momentary rest throughout my nervous system; up until my next forward.  An unpleasant sensation that makes you want to sprint until all energy and nerves are exerted but I was paralyzed, formulating horrific images and questions to quell those thoughts

The news seemed to come from nowhere and still has me puzzled today; though I was a lying, addict and narcissist at the time but who isn't...  Old familiar feelings of loss, jealousy, abandonment, lonlyness, fear, depression, shame, and anger would all arrive simultaneously hurting every inch of my being, without remorse or abandon. This stage of shock and loss was familiar to me, but once she left, and my habits became worse, I knew it was time to face the root causes of my unhappiness and behaviors.  The pain hadn't even truly commencing yet.  When my, now, ex-wife asked what was wrong, I calmy said, "Oh, I'ts just some anxiety right now, it should pass." That anxiety and emotional torture persisted for months apon months, Fairly consistently, and has only just recently subsided, 7 months after the fact.

I'd like to write about this experience that turned into a culmination of events I now refer to as "the perfect storm." Rather than a monotonous, congruent timeline of events, I'd like to focus on specific, out of the ordinary, stories and fallacies that evoke common emotions and themes shared by all humans; ranging from loss and abandonment, inadequacies of self, addictions, etc... But also the human will to persevere despite any roadblock, where you will meet a close ally, your warrior spirit, and the tho of you will have tea and discuss politics. But no, your warrior exists and makes an appearance when we have no alternatives. lastly, Im excited to share how rewarding the glorious sensation of triumph feels on any level when your task is seemingly unattainable. 

The stories are still unfolding as I'm still in the midst of battle but My thought is it will be therapudic. If enjoyable, there are many other experiences that are both entertaining as well as frightening. So, I promise, I'll make it out Of this, stronger and openly willing to help any other souls in pain since I know exactly how hard suffering can be. I'm not going to bullshit you and say, "stay positive"... Or "keep your head up". Just stay alive and fight one battle at a time, one day at a time.
