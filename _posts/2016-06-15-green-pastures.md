  The familiar path under foot sent shocks from toes, up through the limbs and
  spine and then burst like a firework throughout the back of his skull and
  neck, only to repeat the proccess, but downward through my electrical nervous
  system. Old familiar feeling of loss, jealousy, abandonment, lonlyness, fear,
  depression, shame, and anger would detonate simultaneously affecting me
  physically as well as emotionally. When my now ex-wife asked what's wrong, it
  could only be explained as, "Oh, I'm just feeling some anxiety right now, no
  big deal."
