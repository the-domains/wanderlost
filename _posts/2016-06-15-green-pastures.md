That anxiety and emotional torture persisted for months apon months, Fairly consistently, and has only just recently subsided, 7 months after the fact. I''d like to write about this experience that turned into a culmination of events I now refer to as "the perfect storm." Rather than a monotonous, congruent timeline of events, I''d like to focus on specific, out of the ordinary, stories and fallacies that evoke common emotions and themes shared by all humans; ranging from loss and abandonment, inadequacies of self, addictions, etc...

The familiar path under foot sent shocks from toes, up through limbs and spine and burst like fireworks throughout my skull and neck; only to repeat the proccess, downward throughout the electrical nervous system until the next step; and the process repeated itself while the unexcpected news took form as a possible reality. Old familiar feeling of loss, jealousy, abandonment, lonlyness, fear, depression, shame, and anger would arrive simultaneously and hurt every inch of my being, without remorse or abandon. This stage which I had been familiar with before, doesn't allow any sanctuary from what can only be described as pure panic.

I'll take my time with sharing stories as I'm still in the midst of my own battle. But I promise, I'll come out tbe other side, stronger and more than willing to help any other souls in pain since I know exactly how hard it can be. I'm not going to bullshit you and say, "stay positive"... Just stay alive and fight one battle at a time.
