The familiar path under foot in the Sonoma hillside sent shocks from my toes, up through limbs and spine and burst like fireworks throughout my skull and neck; only to repeat the downward electrical proccess throughout my nervous system until my next step; Repeating the process again. 

The news seemed to come from nowhere which still has me puzzled to this day, though i was a lying addict at the time, as was she. Old familiar feelings of loss, jealousy, abandonment, lonlyness, fear, depression, shame, and anger would arrive simultaneously and hurt every inch of my being without remorse or abandon. This stage in shock of loss I had been familiar with before, yet didnt allow sanctuarY from the pure panic Well I was only commencing.

When my, now, ex-wife asked what was wrong, I calmy said, "Oh, I'ts just some anxiety right now, it should pass." That anxiety and emotional torture persisted for months apon months, Fairly consistently, and has only just recently subsided, 7 months after the fact. I'd like to write about this experience that turned into a culmination of events I now refer to as "the perfect storm." Rather than a monotonous, congruent timeline of events, I'd like to focus on specific, out of the ordinary, stories and fallacies that evoke common emotions and themes shared by all humans; ranging from loss and abandonment, inadequacies of self, addictions, etc... But also the human will to persevere despite any roadblock, where you will meet a close ally, your warrior spirit, and the tho of you will have tea and discuss politics. But no, your warrior exists and makes an appearance when we have no alternatives. lastly, Im excited to share how rewarding the glorious sensation of triumph feels on any level when your task is seemingly unattainable. 

I'll take my time with sharing stories as I'm still in the midst of my own battle. But I promise, I'll come out tbe other side, stronger and more than willing to help any other souls in pain since I know exactly how hard it can be. I'm not going to bullshit you and say, "stay positive"... Just stay alive and fight one battle at a time, one day at a time.!!
