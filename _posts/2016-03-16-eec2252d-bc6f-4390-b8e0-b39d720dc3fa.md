  "Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out of your
  house, so that new joy can find space to enter. It shakes the yellow leaves
  from the bough of your heart, so that fresh, green leaves can grow in their
  place. It pulls up the rotten roots, so that new roots hidden beneath have
  room to grow. Whatever sorrow shakes from your heart, far better things will
  take their place."
