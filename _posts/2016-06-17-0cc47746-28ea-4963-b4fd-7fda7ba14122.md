  “For me the world is weird because it is stupendous, awesome, mysterious,
  unfathomable; my interest has been to convince you that you must assume
  responsibility for being here, in this marvelous world, in this marvelous
  desert, in this marvelous time. I want to convince you that you must learn to
  make every act count, since you are going to be here for only a short while,
  in fact, too short for witnessing all the marvels of it.”  ,
